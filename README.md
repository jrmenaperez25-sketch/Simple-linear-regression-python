## 🎯 Objectives

The main goals of this project are:

- Understand the fundamentals of linear regression
- Explore the relationship between two numerical variables
- Implement a linear regression model step by step
- Interpret model parameters and results
- Visualize data, regression line, and residuals

This notebook demonstrates essential skills for **Data Analyst** and **Machine Learning** roles.

   - Detection of trends and patterns

3. **Simple Linear Regression**
   - Mathematical formulation of the model
   - Estimation of regression coefficients
   - Interpretation of slope and intercept

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Visual inspection of the fitted model
   - Analysis of residuals
   - Discussion of model performance

5. **Conclusions**
   - Summary of findings
   - Limitations of linear regression
   - Possible extensions
